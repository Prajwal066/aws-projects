# AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on AWS and Generative AI
mini-projects created for learning, experimentation, and portfolio building.
Each project is designed to demonstrate practical understanding of core
AWS services and concepts, with a strong focus on the **AWS Cloud Practitioner
(CLF-C02)** certification.

The projects emphasize **managed services, cloud-native design, and
cost-aware usage**, rather than heavy infrastructure setup.
